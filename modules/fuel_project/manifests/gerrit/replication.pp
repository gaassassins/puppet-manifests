# Replication path consists of:

#
# Parameters:
#   [*host*] - hostname of Gerrit to push to
#   [*path*] - url path to Gerrit to push to
#   [*user*] - user to authenticate with replication target
#   [*auth_group*] - name of a group that the remote should use to access the
#     repositories
#   [*config_file_path*] - configuration file path
#   [*default_force_update*] - allow use force update for project
#   [*mirror*] - remove remote branches that absent locally or invisible to the
#     replication

#   [*projects*] - names of the projects to replicate
#   [*public_key*] - public key to use for SSH communication
#   [*push*] - references to replicate on target repositories
#   [*remote_name_style*] - part of a project name to use as name
#     of a repository on tagert host
#   [*replicate_permissions*] - permissions-only projects and the
#     refs/meta/config branch will also be replicated to the remote site
#   [*replication_delay*] - number of seconds to wait before scheduling a remote
#     push operation
